# Diabetes Risk Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project explores a healthcare dataset to identify patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes using Python-based exploratory data analysis.
The analysis focuses on understanding relationships between clinical variables and diabetes outcome.


## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymised patient health information, including glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), age and a binary diabetes outcome variable
(0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic).


## Analysis Approach
The project involved:
- Inspecting and summarising the dataset to understand its structure
- Cleaning clinical variables by treating zero values as missing data
- Visualising patient demographics and diabetes outcome distribution
- Performing correlation analysis to examine associations between clinical variables and diabetes outcome
- Assessing diabetes prevalence across age groups


## Key Findings
- Glucose levels show the strongest association with diabetes outcome
- BMI and age are positively associated with diabetes risk
- Diabetes prevalence increases across older age groups
- The dataset exhibits class imbalance, which is common in healthcare data


## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Motivation
I am a Biomedical Science undergraduate student transitioning into Data Science and
Bioinformatics, aiming to apply computational analysis to healthcare data.

## Future Work
- Build a simple machine learning model
- Extend analysis to additional healthcare datasets
