# Healthcare Data Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project explores a public healthcare dataset to identify patterns and
risk factors associated with diabetes using the Python software.

## Dataset
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle)

## Tools & Libraries Utilised
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualisation
- Correlation analysis

## Key Insights
- Higher glucose levels and BMI are strongly associated with diabetes
- Age is a contributing risk factor

## Motivation
I am a Biomedical Science undergraduate student transitioning into Data Science and
Bioinformatics, aiming to apply computational analysis to healthcare data.

## Future Work
- Build a simple machine learning model
- Extend analysis to additional healthcare datasets
